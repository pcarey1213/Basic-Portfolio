             <p>I'm a dude who lives in South Philadelphia. I'm 27 years old. My birthday is December 13th. 
                 Some things I enjoy include: running, listening to music (80's, 90's, and today), practicing guitar, looking at and sharing memes, and trying out new recipes. 
                 I also love travel and don't do it enough. 
                 My next favorite destination would be somewhere in South America. 
                 I'd like to get better at coding, because I thought the Matrix was the coolest movie I'd ever seen at 13, and still pretty much feel the same way.</p>
